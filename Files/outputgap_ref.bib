abstract = {This paper reviews tests for structural change in linear regression models from the generalized fluctuation test framework as well as from the F test (Chow test) framework. It introduces a unified approach for implementing these tests and presents how these ideashave been realized in an R package called strucchange. Enhancing the standard significance test approach the package contains methods to fit, plot and test empirical fluctuationprocesses (like CUSUM, MOSUM and estimates-based processes) and to compute, plot and test sequences of F statistics with the supF, aveF and expF test. Thus, it makes powerful tools available to display information about structural changes in regression relationshipsand to assess their significance. Furthermore, it is described how incoming data can be monitored.},

We show that ex post revisions of the estimated gap are of the same order of magnitude as the estimated gap itself and that these revisions are highly persistent. Although important, the revision of pub- lished data is not the primary source of revisions in measured output gaps; the bulk of the problem is due to the pervasive unreliability of end-of- sample estimates of the trend in output. Multivariate methods that incor- porate information from inflation to estimate the output gap are not more reliable than their univariate counterparts.},

abstract = {This paper reports on revision properties of different de-trending and smoothing methods (cycle estimation methods), including PAT with MCD smoothing, a double Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and the Christiano-Fitzgerald (CF) filter. The different cycle estimation methods are rated on their revision performance in a simulated real time experiment. Our goal is to find a robust method that gives early turning point signals and steady turning point signals. The revision performance of the methods has been evaluated according to bias, overall revision size and signal stability measures. In a second phase, we investigate if revision performance is improved using stabilizing forecasts or by changing the cycle estimation window from the baseline 6 and 96 months (i.e. filtering out high frequency noise with a cycle length shorter than 6 months and removing trend components with cycle length longer than 96 months) to 12 and 120 months. The results show that, for all tested time series, the PAT de-trending method is outperformed by both the HP or CF filter. In addition, the results indicate that the HP filter outperforms the CF filter in turning point signal stability but has a weaker performance in absolute numerical precision. Short horizon stabilizing forecasts tend to improve revision characteristics of both methods and the changed filter window also delivers more robust turning point estimates.},

abstract = {The Beveridge-Nelson decomposition based on autoregressive models produces estimates of the output gap that are strongly at odds with widely held beliefs about transitory movements in economic activ- ity. This is due to parameter estimates implying a high signal-to-noise ratio in terms of the variance of trend shocks as a fraction of the overall forecast error variance. When we impose a lower signal-to-noise ratio, the resulting Beveridge-Nelson filter produces a more intuitive estimate ofthe output gap that is large in amplitude and highly persistent, and it typically increases in expansions and decreases in recessions. Notably, our approach is also reli- able in the sense of being subject to smaller revisions and predicting future output growth and inflation better than other trend-cycle decompositions that impose a low signal-to-noise ratio.},

Alternatively, revisions from econometric output gap estimates have not experienced a similar improvement. We show that the overestimation of potential output in real time following the 1991–92 recession explains the large revisions in the first half of the sample. Although Phillips-curve inflation forecasts slightly worsen when conditioned on real time instead of final gaps, their relative poor performance reflects the general lack of inflation predictability rather than real-time gap measurement issues.},

@techreport{Recession1,
abstract = {A recession is one of several discrete phases in the overall business cycle. The term may often be used loosely to describe an economy that is slowing down or characterized by weakness in at least one major sector like the housing market. When used by economists, "recession" means a significant decline in overall economic activity that lasts more than a few months. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) business cycle dating committee is the generally recognized arbiter of the dates of the beginnings and ends of recessions. As with all statistics, it takes some time to compile the data, which means they are only available after the events they describe. Moreover, because it takes time to discern changes in trends given the usual month-to-month volatility in economic indicators, and because the data are subject to revision, it takes some time before the dating committee can agree that a recession began at a certain date. It can be a year or more after the fact that the dating committee announces the date of the beginning of a recession. At the moment, there seems to be a growing sentiment that the U.S. economy is in, or is headed into, a recession. All that seems necessary for the word "recession" to be heard in public discourse is for economic growth to slow, for the unemployment rate to rise, or for there to be some turmoil in a sector of the economy large enough to affect large numbers of households. The term may often be used loosely to describe an economy that is slowing down or characterized by weakness in at least one major sector like the housing market. When economists use the term, however, they try to do so consistently. Recessions typically have common characteristics and so economists try to identify the beginning and ending dates of recessions in order to further their overall understanding of the economy.},

abstract = {This paper develops a set of approximate band-pass filters designed for use in a wide range of economic applications. In particular we design and implement a specific band pass filter which isolates business cycle fluctuations in macroeconomic time-series. This filterwas designed to isolate fluctuations in the data whihch persist for periods of two through eisght years. This filter also "detrends" the data in the sense that it will render stationary timeseries that are integrated if order two or less, or that contain deterministic time trends. We apply our filter to serveral of the key macroeconomic time series and describe the picture of the US postwar business cycle that emerges from our analysis. We also provide detailed comparisons with several detrending methods.},

We distinguish between univariate – which estimate trend output on the basis of actual output, without taking into account the information contained in other variables – and multivariate methods — which incorporate useful information on some other variables, based on economic theory. We present the main advantages and drawbacks of the different methods.},
